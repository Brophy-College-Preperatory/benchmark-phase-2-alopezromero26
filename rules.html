            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Soccer contains many rules and rules have changed over time, but these are the most prominent. 1. The Ball is in Play or Out of Play
                In Play: The ball remains in play unless it entirely crosses the goal line or touchline, whether on the ground or in the air.
                Out of Play: The ball is out of play when it has completely crossed the boundary lines or if the referee stops play.
                2. The Duration of the Match
                Two 45-minute halves with a 15-minute halftime break.
                Additional time (stoppage time) is added at the referee’s discretion for injuries, substitutions, or other stoppages.
                3. Scoring a Goal
                A goal is awarded when the ball fully crosses the goal line between the goalposts and beneath the crossbar, provided no foul or rule infringement occurred during the process.
                4. The Offside Rule
                A player is in an offside position if they are nearer to their opponent’s goal line than the ball and the second-last defender when the ball is played to them, except when they are in their own half or level with the second-last defender.
                Being offside is penalized only if the player is actively involved in play.
                5. Fouls and Misconduct
                Actions like kicking, tripping, pushing, holding, or striking an opponent are fouls.
                Dangerous play or unsporting behavior can lead to a direct free kick, penalty, or disciplinary actions (yellow or red cards).
                6. Free Kicks
                Direct Free Kick: The ball can be kicked directly into the goal.
                Indirect Free Kick: Another player must touch the ball before a goal can be scored.
                7. Penalty Kicks
                Awarded for fouls committed by the defending team inside their own penalty area.
                The kicker takes the shot from the penalty mark with only the goalkeeper defending.
                8. Throw-Ins
                When the ball crosses the touchline, the opposing team of the last player to touch the ball is awarded a throw-in.
                The ball must be thrown with both hands, from behind the head, and both feet must be on the ground.
                9. Goal Kicks
                Awarded when the attacking team last touches the ball before it crosses the goal line without resulting in a goal.</p>
